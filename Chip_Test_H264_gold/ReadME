1. Main Scripts to run (Please see the header of the files for details):
    ChipTest.m
    ChipTestFIFOdbg.m
    ChipTest_CDsweepQP.m

2. Change the variable 'filename' in these files to re-target to the new bitstream outputs that we want to test.

3. Change the variable 'Quant' and 'QP' to change quantization parameter. It should be consistent with 
what is used to generated the bitstream.

4. Change the variable 'h' and 'w' (image height and width) as you wish if we still have problems with the bottom McB row.
	
5. The script 'ChipTest.m' is meant for bitstream from a bug-free chip that is streamed out using H.264's direct path to Flash IF.
It did not work last time because some segments of the bitstream messed up. This time if the direct path is totally ok it should work (probably some extra tweaking needed). 
If not please contact me and I will setup a new template.
